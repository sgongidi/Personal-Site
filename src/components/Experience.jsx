                                The UNC Computer Science Department created the UNC Summer of Code 
                                2020 program to provide a remote internship-like experience for students 
                                who have experienced difficulty securing a summer internship as a result 
                                of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worked remotely with a small team of student 
                                developers, software engineer mentors, and the UNC CS Department as clients.
                                Used Agile development methods to create the UNC CS Resum√© Database website within 
                                the 6 week program length, ending with a beta test demo, and launching at the 
                                start of the school year with over 200 student sign-ups in the first week.
